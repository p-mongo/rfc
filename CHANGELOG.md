# rfc Changelog

## 0.2.x

- Aif and Rif formatters will show up to 10 pending examples in the summary
at the end of the test run. This is intended to make the output usable in
test suites that contain many pending examples (thousands) while retaining
some diagnostics when pending examples are unexpected, unlike Fubar which
either shows all pending examples or none of them.

## 0.1.x

- System load statistics added to Rif output.

## 0.0.x

- Aif and Rif formatters.
