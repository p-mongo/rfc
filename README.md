# RSpec Formatter Collection

A collection of RSpec formatters.

## RSpec Insta-Failing Formatter (RIFF)

RIFF was originally developed for running large test suites in a
continuous integration environment, where the runs are non-interactive
and the output is saved to a file/stream of some kind.
It has the following features;

- Immediate error/failure reporting
- Timestamped percentage progress output
- No output overwrites or terminal manipulation
